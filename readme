RBF-QR Matlab files v1.3
  comments/questions: Mike McCourt <mccomic@iit.edu>

Source code is kept in the source folder
Examples are kept in the examples folder
Files from other authors are kept in the fromothers folder

To run an example, you first boot up Matlab
Then run the setup:
>> rbfsetup
This makes sure the necessary files are in the path

You can use rbfsetup to set runtime parameters for RBF-QR.
If you want you could instead use:
  global GAUSSQR_PARAMETERS
and then set whatever parameter you'd like.  If you do that, don't call
rbfsetup again or it will erase any changes you made.

Now you can run examples, including
>> ex1_gqr
This shows that GaussQR works for a simple example
You also can use
>> ex2_mqr
This shows that MaternQR can produce stable interpolants
