% Build experiments with SVD + regularization if desired
% One set of experiments should involve sampling from LOOCV chi-squared
% Experiments involving uniform distribution
% Sampling from the likelihood
% 
% Strategy: Find a point which is "representative" of the density
%   Consider a density expanded around that point
%   Randomly sample with each dimension and point
% Analysis: Consider the impact of the spread on the quality of the
%   approximation and/or the stability of the system
%
% Will need to run experiments in different dimensions
% Any differential equations examples?
